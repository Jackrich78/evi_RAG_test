## Specialist Sub-Agents

When using this template for **specialist sub-agents** (library/framework experts created via `/create-specialist`):

**Auto-Population Sources:**
- Use Archon RAG, WebSearch, and User input to populate sections
- Prioritize official documentation and maintained sources
- Target <2 minutes total creation time (30s template + 90s research)

**Key Sections for Specialists:**
- **Core Responsibilities**: 3-5 library-specific expertise areas
- **Common Patterns**: Framework-specific patterns from official docs
- **Known Gotchas**: Pitfalls, workarounds, and anti-patterns
- **Integration Points**: How to use with other tools/frameworks
- **Tools Access**: Typically Archon RAG, WebSearch, Read, Write

**Naming Conventions:**
- Filename: `[library-name]-specialist.md` (kebab-case)
- Name field: `[Library] Specialist`
- Example: `pydantic-ai-specialist.md` → "PydanticAI Specialist"

**Knowledge Sources:**
Document research sources used for auto-population:
- Archon RAG: List specific sources queried
- WebSearch: Note URLs and retrieval dates
- User Input: Flag manual sections added

See [Specialist Creator Agent](specialist-creator.md) for automated creation workflow.
