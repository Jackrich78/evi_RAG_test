## Functional Acceptance Criteria

### Product Ingestion (US-004-1)

**AC-FEAT-004-001: Fetch Products from Notion**
- **Given** a valid Notion database ID is configured for products
- **When** the ingestion process runs
- **Then** all products are fetched from the Notion database with complete field data (name, description, category, supplier, compliance_tags, use_cases, price_range)

**AC-FEAT-004-002: Generate Product Embeddings**
- **Given** a product has been fetched from Notion with description and use_cases
- **When** the embedding generation process runs
- **Then** a semantic embedding vector is created using text-embedding-3-small model and stored in the database

**AC-FEAT-004-003: Store Products in Database**
- **Given** products are parsed with embeddings generated
- **When** the storage process runs
- **Then** products are inserted into the `products` table with all fields properly mapped and no schema violations

**AC-FEAT-004-004: Handle Duplicate Products**
- **Given** a product with the same Notion page_id already exists in the database
- **When** the ingestion process encounters the product
- **Then** the existing product record is updated (not duplicated) with the latest Notion data

**AC-FEAT-004-005: Manual Ingestion Trigger**
- **Given** an administrator has database access
- **When** they execute the product ingestion command/function
- **Then** the ingestion process completes successfully and reports the number of products processed

---

### Product Search (US-004-2)

**AC-FEAT-004-006: Semantic Search Query**
- **Given** a natural language query in Dutch (e.g., "veiligheidshelm voor bouwplaats")
- **When** the product search function is called
- **Then** relevant products are returned ranked by semantic similarity (cosine distance)

**AC-FEAT-004-007: Search Result Content**
- **Given** a product search query returns results
- **When** the results are formatted
- **Then** each result includes name, description, category, supplier, and compliance_tags

**AC-FEAT-004-008: Search Performance**
- **Given** a product database with 100+ products
- **When** a semantic search query is executed for top 10 results
- **Then** the query completes in less than 500ms

**AC-FEAT-004-009: Dutch Language Support**
- **Given** a search query in Dutch (e.g., "gehoorbescherming")
- **When** the search is performed
- **Then** relevant products with Dutch descriptions are returned correctly

**AC-FEAT-004-010: Empty Search Results**
- **Given** a search query that matches no products
- **When** the search is performed
- **Then** an empty list is returned without errors

---

### Compliance Filtering (US-004-3)

**AC-FEAT-004-011: Single Compliance Filter**
- **Given** a user specifies a compliance tag filter (e.g., "CE")
- **When** the product search is executed
- **Then** only products with the specified compliance tag are returned

**AC-FEAT-004-012: Multiple Compliance Filters**
- **Given** a user specifies multiple compliance tags (e.g., ["CE", "EN 397"])
- **When** the product search is executed
- **Then** only products matching all specified tags are returned (AND logic)

**AC-FEAT-004-013: Combined Semantic and Filter Search**
- **Given** a natural language query and compliance filter(s)
- **When** the combined search is executed
- **Then** results are semantically relevant AND match compliance requirements

**AC-FEAT-004-014: Normalized Compliance Tags**
- **Given** compliance tags are stored in various formats in Notion (e.g., "ce", "CE", " CE ")
- **When** products are ingested
- **Then** tags are normalized (uppercase, trimmed) for consistent filtering

**AC-FEAT-004-015: Invalid Compliance Filter**
- **Given** a user specifies a non-existent compliance tag
- **When** the filtered search is executed
- **Then** an empty result set is returned without errors

---

### Product-Guideline Linking (US-004-4)

**AC-FEAT-004-016: Link Products by Category**
- **Given** a guideline exists with a category (e.g., "head protection")
- **When** a product with matching category is ingested (e.g., "hard hats")
- **Then** the product is associated with the guideline for cross-referencing

**AC-FEAT-004-017: Link Products by Use Case Keywords**
- **Given** a product has use_cases containing keywords (e.g., "construction sites")
- **When** a guideline search matches those keywords
- **Then** the product appears in related products suggestions

**AC-FEAT-004-018: Related Products in Search Results**
- **Given** a specialist queries guidelines about a topic (e.g., "hearing protection")
- **When** the search includes product recommendations
- **Then** relevant products are returned as "Related Products" alongside guideline results

**AC-FEAT-004-019: Maintain Linkage During Updates**
- **Given** a product's category or use_cases are updated in Notion
- **When** the product is re-ingested
- **Then** the product-guideline links are updated to reflect the new associations

## Non-Functional Acceptance Criteria

### Data Quality

**AC-FEAT-004-020: Complete Data Ingestion**
- **Given** the Notion product database contains N products
- **When** ingestion completes
- **Then** 100% of products are successfully stored with embeddings (no data loss)

**AC-FEAT-004-021: Handle Missing Optional Fields**
- **Given** a product in Notion has missing optional fields (e.g., price_range, supplier)
- **When** the product is ingested
- **Then** the product is still stored with null values for missing fields and a warning is logged

**AC-FEAT-004-022: Validate Required Fields**
- **Given** a product in Notion is missing required fields (name or description)
- **When** the ingestion process encounters it
- **Then** the product is skipped, an error is logged, and ingestion continues for other products

---

### Performance

**AC-FEAT-004-023: Batch Processing Efficiency**
- **Given** a product catalog with 500+ products
- **When** ingestion runs
- **Then** products are processed in batches (100 per batch) to avoid memory issues

**AC-FEAT-004-024: Embedding Generation Speed**
- **Given** a single product requires embedding generation
- **When** the embedding API call is made
- **Then** the embedding is generated in less than 2 seconds per product

**AC-FEAT-004-025: Index Performance**
- **Given** the products table has a pgvector index on embeddings
- **When** a semantic search query is executed
- **Then** the database uses the index (verified via EXPLAIN query plan)

---

### Security & Privacy

**AC-FEAT-004-026: Secure API Key Storage**
- **Given** the Notion API key is required for ingestion
- **When** the application starts
- **Then** the API key is loaded from environment variables (not hardcoded)

**AC-FEAT-004-027: Database Connection Security**
- **Given** the ingestion process connects to PostgreSQL
- **When** the connection is established
- **Then** SSL/TLS encryption is used for the connection

---

### Error Handling

**AC-FEAT-004-028: Notion API Failure Handling**
- **Given** the Notion API returns an error (rate limit, network failure)
- **When** ingestion is in progress
- **Then** the error is logged, ingestion retries with exponential backoff, and fails gracefully after max retries

**AC-FEAT-004-029: Database Connection Failure**
- **Given** the database connection fails during ingestion
- **When** a product is being stored
- **Then** the error is logged, transaction is rolled back, and ingestion can be re-run without data corruption

**AC-FEAT-004-030: Invalid Embedding Response**
- **Given** the embedding API returns an invalid response
- **When** processing a product
- **Then** the product is skipped, an error is logged with details, and ingestion continues

---

## Edge Cases

**AC-FEAT-004-031: Empty Product Catalog**
- **Given** the Notion product database is empty
- **When** ingestion runs
- **Then** the process completes successfully with "0 products processed" message

**AC-FEAT-004-032: Products with Special Characters**
- **Given** a product name contains special characters (e.g., "Safety Gogglesâ„¢ - Model #42")
- **When** the product is ingested
- **Then** special characters are preserved in the database

**AC-FEAT-004-033: Very Long Product Descriptions**
- **Given** a product has a description exceeding 5000 characters
- **When** the embedding is generated
- **Then** the description is truncated to the embedding model's token limit and a warning is logged

**AC-FEAT-004-034: Concurrent Ingestion Prevention**
- **Given** an ingestion process is already running
- **When** a second ingestion is triggered
- **Then** the second process detects the lock and exits with a warning (no concurrent ingestion)
