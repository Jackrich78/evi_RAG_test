# Acceptance Criteria: OpenWebUI Integration

**Feature ID:** FEAT-007
**Created:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** Draft

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: Chat Interface for Guideline Queries

**As a** EVI 360 safety specialist
**I want to** query workplace safety guidelines using natural language in a chat interface
**So that** I can quickly find relevant safety information without learning API syntax

#### AC-007-001: Basic Guideline Query
**Given** I am logged into the OpenWebUI chat interface
**When** I type "Wat zijn de richtlijnen voor werken op hoogte?" (What are guidelines for working at height?)
**Then** the system returns tier 1 summary guidelines for working at height in Dutch
**And** the response appears within 2 seconds
**And** the formatting is readable with proper line breaks and structure

#### AC-007-002: Multi-Tier Guideline Navigation
**Given** I have received a tier 1 summary response
**When** I ask a follow-up question "Geef me meer details" (Give me more details)
**Then** the system retrieves tier 2 key facts for the same guideline topic
**And** maintains context from the previous query
**And** provides clear navigation hints for accessing tier 3 if available

#### AC-007-003: Product Recommendation Integration
**Given** I am viewing guideline information
**When** I ask "Welke producten raad je aan voor deze situatie?" (Which products do you recommend for this situation?)
**Then** the system returns relevant products from the catalog with compliance tags
**And** includes product names, descriptions, and safety certifications
**And** links products to specific guideline requirements

---

### Story 2: Multi-Turn Conversation Support

**As a** EVI 360 safety specialist
**I want to** have natural multi-turn conversations about safety topics
**So that** I can refine my queries and explore related guidelines without starting over

#### AC-007-004: Context Retention Across Turns
**Given** I have asked 3 questions about ladder safety in a conversation
**When** I ask "Wat zijn de verschillen met steigers?" (What are the differences with scaffolding?)
**Then** the system understands I'm comparing ladder vs. scaffolding safety
**And** maintains the conversation history visible in the UI
**And** provides contextually relevant comparisons

#### AC-007-005: Topic Switching Detection
**Given** I am in a conversation about fall protection
**When** I ask an unrelated question "Wat zijn de regels voor gehoorbescherming?" (What are the rules for hearing protection?)
**Then** the system detects the topic change
**And** starts a new context for hearing protection guidelines
**And** does not confuse previous fall protection context with new topic

#### AC-007-006: Conversation History Persistence
**Given** I am logged into the system
**When** I close the browser and return later
**Then** I can see my previous conversation history
**And** I can continue previous conversations from where I left off
**And** conversation history is scoped to my user account only

---

### Story 3: Secure User Authentication

**As a** EVI 360 administrator
**I want to** ensure only authorized users can access the chat interface
**So that** our safety guidelines remain protected and usage is tracked

#### AC-007-007: Login Requirement
**Given** I navigate to the OpenWebUI interface
**When** I attempt to access the chat without logging in
**Then** I am redirected to a login page
**And** I cannot send queries until authenticated
**And** I see clear instructions for obtaining access credentials

#### AC-007-008: Session Management
**Given** I have successfully logged in
**When** my session expires after 2 hours of inactivity
**Then** I am prompted to re-authenticate
**And** my conversation history is preserved after re-login
**And** I can resume my previous session state

#### AC-007-009: Multi-User Session Isolation
**Given** two users are logged in simultaneously
**When** both users send queries at the same time
**Then** each user's conversation remains isolated
**And** no cross-contamination of responses occurs
**And** each user sees only their own chat history

---

### Story 4: Docker Deployment

**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want to** deploy OpenWebUI alongside FastAPI using Docker Compose
**So that** the system is easy to deploy and scale in production

#### AC-007-010: Docker Compose Configuration
**Given** I have the project repository cloned
**When** I run `docker-compose up` in the project root
**Then** all services start successfully (OpenWebUI, FastAPI, PostgreSQL)
**And** OpenWebUI is accessible at http://localhost:3000
**And** FastAPI is accessible at http://localhost:8000
**And** health checks pass for all containers within 30 seconds

#### AC-007-011: Environment Configuration
**Given** I need to configure API keys and database credentials
**When** I create a `.env` file with required variables
**Then** all services read configuration from environment variables
**And** sensitive values are not hardcoded in Docker images
**And** the system provides clear error messages for missing variables

#### AC-007-012: Container Persistence
**Given** the system is running with active conversations
**When** I restart the Docker containers
**Then** conversation history is preserved in PostgreSQL
**And** users can resume their sessions after restart
**And** no data loss occurs during normal restarts

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

#### AC-007-013: Empty or Invalid Queries
**Given** I am in the chat interface
**When** I submit an empty message or only whitespace
**Then** the system prompts me to enter a valid question
**And** does not make unnecessary API calls
**And** provides example queries to guide me

#### AC-007-014: Guideline Not Found
**Given** I query for a guideline that doesn't exist in the database
**When** I ask "Wat zijn de regels voor ruimtereizen?" (What are the rules for space travel?)
**Then** the system responds with "Geen richtlijnen gevonden" (No guidelines found)
**And** suggests related topics or broader search terms
**And** logs the query for potential content gap analysis

#### AC-007-015: API Backend Unavailable
**Given** the FastAPI backend is down or unreachable
**When** I send a query in the chat interface
**Then** I receive an error message "Backend service tijdelijk niet beschikbaar" (Backend service temporarily unavailable)
**And** the system retries the request automatically (max 3 attempts)
**And** provides an estimated time for resolution if available

#### AC-007-016: Concurrent Request Handling
**Given** 10 users are sending queries simultaneously
**When** all queries are submitted within the same second
**Then** all users receive responses within 3 seconds (P95)
**And** no requests timeout or fail due to concurrency
**And** response accuracy is not degraded under load

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

#### AC-007-017: Dutch Language Accuracy
**Given** all safety guidelines are in Dutch
**When** I query in Dutch using natural language
**Then** the LLM correctly interprets Dutch queries
**And** responses maintain proper Dutch grammar and terminology
**And** technical safety terms are not mistranslated

#### AC-007-018: Response Time Performance
**Given** I send a guideline query
**When** the system processes the request
**Then** tier 1 responses return in <2 seconds (P95)
**And** tier 2/3 responses return in <3 seconds (P95)
**And** product recommendation queries return in <2.5 seconds (P95)

#### AC-007-019: Mobile Responsiveness
**Given** I access OpenWebUI from a mobile device
**When** I use the chat interface on a screen <768px width
**Then** the UI is fully responsive and usable
**And** all features work on touch interfaces
**And** text is readable without horizontal scrolling

#### AC-007-020: Accessibility Compliance
**Given** I am a user with accessibility needs
**When** I use screen reader software with OpenWebUI
**Then** all chat messages are announced clearly
**And** keyboard navigation works for all features
**And** color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
