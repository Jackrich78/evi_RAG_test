- ✅ AC-002-102: Empty Pages (none encountered, handled gracefully)
- ✅ AC-002-103: File Write Errors (none encountered)

- ✅ AC-002-202: Data Integrity (Dutch text preserved, UTF-8 encoding)
- ✅ AC-002-203: Logging & Debugging (detailed logs in `/tmp/feat002_full_ingestion.log`)

### Integration (2/2)
- ✅ AC-002-301: Pipeline Compatibility (existing code unchanged)
- ✅ AC-002-302: Tier Column NULL (all 10,833 chunks have NULL tier)

### Data Requirements (2/2)
- ✅ AC-002-401: Environment Variable Validation (all vars present and valid)
- ✅ AC-002-402: File Naming Convention (87 unique filenames)

**Success Rate:** 100% (17/17)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Documents Ingested | 87/87 (100%) |
| Chunks Created | 10,833 |
| Embeddings Generated | 10,833 (100% coverage) |
| Processing Time | 42.5 minutes |
| Average per File | ~29 seconds |
| Errors | 0 |
| Cost | Minimal (embedding generation only) |
| Database Size | 8.87 MB content |

## What Was Deferred

### Knowledge Graph (Deferred to Phase 6)

**Reason:** Not required for FEAT-002 acceptance criteria, prohibitively slow and expensive for MVP.

**Evidence:**
- 5-file test: 83 minutes, $4.77 cost
- Projected 87 files: 52-78 hours, $83+ cost
- 0 of 17 acceptance criteria mention knowledge graph
- PRD explicitly lists KG in "Out of Scope" section

**Decision:** Build MVP with vector + full-text search first, add knowledge graph later if retrieval quality requires it.

**Exploration Work:** Archived in [exploration/](exploration/) directory with detailed analysis.

### Tier Parsing (Deferred per AC-002-302)

**Reason:** Explicitly deferred in acceptance criteria.

**AC-002-302 States:**
> "Given chunks are stored in PostgreSQL, when querying chunks table, then tier column is NULL for all Notion-sourced chunks (tier parsing deferred)"

**Current State:**
- All 10,833 chunks have `tier = NULL`
- Database schema supports tier column (ready for future enhancement)
- Tier parsing can be added in FEAT-003 or later phase

## Dutch Search Validation

All test queries returned relevant results:

1. ✅ **"veiligheid op de werkplek"** (workplace safety) - 3 results
2. ✅ **"prikaccidenten"** (needle stick accidents) - 3 results
3. ✅ **"beschermingsmiddelen"** (protective equipment) - 3 results
4. ✅ **"zwangerschap en werk"** (pregnancy and work) - 3 results
5. ✅ **"rugklachten"** (back complaints) - 3 results

PostgreSQL Dutch full-text search (`to_tsvector('dutch', ...)`) working correctly.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Acceptance Criteria Driven** - Always checking ACs prevented scope creep
2. **Existing Pipeline Reuse** - No new code needed, just used `--fast` flag
3. **Early Testing** - 5-file subset revealed KG issues before full run
4. **Clear Documentation** - Validation report provides evidence for all claims

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Earlier Cost/Time Analysis** - Could have skipped KG exploration entirely
2. **PRD Clarity** - "Out of Scope" section should have been more prominent
3. **Test Strategy** - Could have validated Dutch search earlier in process

### Key Insight
**"Never assume" principle proved critical.** When knowledge graph showed promising results but high cost, checking back against acceptance criteria revealed it wasn't actually required for FEAT-002 sign-off. This saved 2-3 days of processing time and $83+ in costs.

## Impact & Value

### For EVI 360 Specialists
- ✅ All 87 Dutch workplace safety guidelines now searchable
- ✅ Fast, local search with no API costs or rate limits
- ✅ Foundation ready for intelligent query/retrieval (FEAT-003)

### For Project
- ✅ Phase 2 complete (40% overall progress)
- ✅ De-risked knowledge graph decision (can add later if needed)
- ✅ Validated that existing pipeline works for Notion data
- ✅ Dutch language support confirmed working

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ Zero errors across 10,833 chunks

## Next Steps: FEAT-003 (Query & Retrieval)

With 87 guidelines ingested and searchable, we're ready to build the query/retrieval interface:

### FEAT-003 Objectives
1. **Search Tools** - Tier-aware query functions
2. **Query Complexity Detection** - Simple vs complex queries
3. **CLI Search Command** - `python3 cli.py search "Dutch query"`
4. **Result Formatting** - Display results with tier badges and relevance scores

### Prerequisites (All Met)
- ✅ 87 Dutch guidelines ingested (FEAT-002 complete)
- ✅ PostgreSQL Dutch full-text search enabled
- ✅ 10,833 chunks with embeddings
- ✅ Hybrid search SQL function ready (`hybrid_search()`)

**Estimated Effort:** 12-17 hours
