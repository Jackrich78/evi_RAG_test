# Knowledge Graph Performance Analysis & Next Steps

## üêå Why Is It So Slow?

### Current Performance

**Per Episode Processing Time: ~20-30 seconds**

Breakdown:
1. **LLM API call** to `gpt-4.1-mini` (10-20 seconds)
   - Extracts entities and relationships from episode content
   - Generates structured output (JSON schema)
   - This is the main bottleneck

2. **Embedding generation** (1-2 seconds)
   - Creates vector embedding for episode content
   - Uses `text-embedding-3-small` model

3. **Neo4j operations** (1-2 seconds)
   - Stores nodes (Entity, Episodic, Community)
   - Creates relationships (RELATES_TO, MENTIONS, HAS_MEMBER)
   - Updates graph structure

4. **Rate limiting delay** (0.5 seconds)
   - Built-in delay to avoid API rate limits
   - See `graph_builder.py:142`

### Time Projections

**Current 5-file test:**
- 542 episodes
- Estimated total time: **3-4.5 hours**
- Currently 27% done after 83 minutes

**Full 87-file dataset:**
- Estimated ~9,400 episodes (108 avg per file √ó 87 files)
- **Estimated time: 52-78 HOURS (2-3 DAYS!)** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is **NOT practical** for production use.

## üß™ How to Test the Knowledge Graph RIGHT NOW

You don't need to wait for full completion. Test with current data:

### Method 1: Python Test Script

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv_linux/bin/activate

# Run knowledge graph test
python3 docs/features/FEAT-002_notion-integration/test_knowledge_graph.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ Graphiti search with Dutch queries
- ‚úÖ Entity relationship queries
- ‚úÖ Graph statistics (nodes, relationships by type)

**Test queries:**
1. "veiligheid op de werkplek" (workplace safety)
2. "prikaccidenten" (needle stick accidents)
3. "beschermingsmiddelen" (protective equipment)
4. "aanstellingskeuring" (pre-employment medical exam)
5. "ARBO regelgeving" (occupational health regulations)

### Method 2: Neo4j Browser (Visual)

1. Open http://localhost:7474/browser/
2. Login: neo4j / password123
3. Run these Cypher queries:

```cypher
// See all node types and counts
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n)[0] as label, count(n) as count
ORDER BY count DESC

// See all relationship types
MATCH ()-[r]->()
RETURN type(r) as type, count(r) as count
ORDER BY count DESC

// Explore a sample subgraph
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
RETURN n, r, m
LIMIT 50

// Search for specific entities
MATCH (n:Entity)
WHERE n.name CONTAINS 'veiligheid'
RETURN n
LIMIT 10

// Find episodes about a topic
MATCH (e:Episodic)
WHERE e.content CONTAINS 'aanstellingskeuring'
RETURN e.name, substring(e.content, 0, 200) as preview
LIMIT 5
```

### Method 3: Direct Agent Query Test

Create a simple test agent script:

```bash
# This would use your agent's query interface
# Tests the full RAG pipeline: retrieval + knowledge graph
```

## üöÄ Next Steps: Two Options

### Option A: Continue Full 87-File Ingestion (SLOW)

**Pros:**
- Complete dataset ingested
- Full knowledge graph built
- Can test with all data

**Cons:**
- Will take 2-3 DAYS to complete
- Not sustainable for future updates
- Expensive (thousands of OpenAI API calls)

**Process:**
```bash
# Just run the full ingestion
python3 ingestion/ingest.py
```

This will process all 87 files sequentially. You can monitor progress the same way.

### Option B: Validate Current Subset & Optimize Later (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- Test functionality NOW with 5 files
- Validate RAG pipeline works correctly
- Identify optimization needs
- Make informed decisions about knowledge graph

**Cons:**
- Not complete dataset
- Will need to re-run after optimization

**Process:**
1. ‚úÖ Wait for current 5-file test to complete (~2 more hours)
2. ‚úÖ Run knowledge graph test script (above)
3. ‚úÖ Test Dutch search queries
4. ‚úÖ Validate RAG retrieval accuracy
5. ‚úÖ Decide on optimizations:
   - Disable knowledge graph temporarily?
   - Use faster LLM model?
   - Batch processing?
   - Async parallel processing?
6. üîÑ Optimize and re-run

## üîß Optimization Ideas (Future)

### 1. Parallel Processing
Process multiple episodes simultaneously (current: sequential)
- **Potential speedup:** 3-5x faster

### 2. Faster LLM Model
Switch from `gpt-4.1-mini` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` for entity extraction
- **Potential speedup:** 2x faster
- **Trade-off:** Lower quality entity extraction

### 3. Batch Episode Creation
Create multiple episodes in a single Graphiti call
- **Potential speedup:** 1.5-2x faster
- **Risk:** More complex error handling

### 4. Skip Knowledge Graph for MVP
Focus on vector + keyword search first
- **Potential speedup:** Instant (seconds instead of hours)
- **Trade-off:** No relationship/entity queries

### 5. Incremental Updates
Only process new/changed documents
- **Long-term solution:** Essential for production

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. **Run knowledge graph test** (don't wait for completion)
2. **Test Dutch search queries** on current data
3. **Decide:** Continue full ingestion OR optimize first?

### Short-term (This Week):
1. If knowledge graph works: Consider optimization strategies
2. If retrieval quality is good without graph: Consider skipping it for MVP
3. Document findings and performance metrics

### Long-term:
1. Implement incremental ingestion
2. Optimize knowledge graph performance
3. Add caching layer
4. Consider alternative graph approaches (simpler entity extraction)

## üìä Current Data Available for Testing

- **Documents:** 5 files (ARBO, Aanstellingskeuringen, Arbeid als medicijn, Arbeidsparticipatie, Arbeidsvermogen)
- **Chunks:** 542 (all embedded in PostgreSQL)
- **Neo4j Nodes:** 806+ (growing)
- **Coverage:** ~6% of total dataset (5/87 files)

**This is enough to:**
- ‚úÖ Test search functionality
- ‚úÖ Validate retrieval quality
- ‚úÖ Test Dutch language support
- ‚úÖ Verify knowledge graph queries
- ‚úÖ Make informed decisions about optimization

## ‚ùì Questions to Answer

1. **Does the knowledge graph improve retrieval quality?**
   - Run comparative tests: with/without graph queries

2. **Is 2-3 days ingestion time acceptable?**
   - One-time cost vs. incremental updates

3. **What's the priority?**
   - Fast MVP with vector search only?
   - Or complete solution with knowledge graph?

4. **What's the update frequency?**
   - Daily: Need fast incremental updates
   - Monthly: Can afford longer ingestion

**Recommendation:** Test NOW with current data, then decide based on results.
