# Acceptance Criteria: True Token Streaming

**Feature:** FEAT-010: True Token Streaming
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-10-31

## Overview

This document defines testable acceptance criteria for implementing true token streaming in the EVI 360 RAG system. All criteria must pass for the feature to be considered complete.

## Functional Requirements

### User Story 1: Real-time Token Display

**As a** workplace safety specialist
**I want** to see LLM responses appear progressively as tokens are generated
**So that** I don't have to wait 5-10 seconds staring at a blank screen

#### AC-FEAT-010-001: First Token Latency
**Given** a user submits a query to the specialist agent
**When** the LLM begins generating a response
**Then** the first token must appear in the UI within 500ms

#### AC-FEAT-010-002: Continuous Streaming
**Given** the LLM is generating a response
**When** tokens are being produced
**Then** tokens must appear continuously without buffering delays between chunks

#### AC-FEAT-010-003: Visual Streaming Indicator
**Given** a streaming response is in progress
**When** the user views the chat interface
**Then** a visual indicator (cursor/animation) must show that streaming is active

### User Story 2: Citation Integration

**As a** workplace safety specialist
**I want** citations to appear correctly during streaming
**So that** I can see source references without waiting for the full response

#### AC-FEAT-010-004: Citation Markers Stream
**Given** the LLM response includes citation markers `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
**When** tokens stream to the frontend
**Then** citation markers must render correctly without breaking across chunk boundaries

#### AC-FEAT-010-005: Citation Panel Updates
**Given** a citation marker appears in the streaming text
**When** the marker is rendered
**Then** the citation panel must update in real-time to show the referenced source

#### AC-FEAT-010-006: Citation Links Functional
**Given** the streaming response is complete
**When** the user clicks a citation marker
**Then** the citation panel must scroll to and highlight the correct source

### User Story 3: Bilingual Support

**As a** workplace safety specialist
**I want** streaming to work for both Dutch and English responses
**So that** I get consistent UX regardless of response language

#### AC-FEAT-010-007: Dutch Streaming
**Given** the user asks a question in Dutch
**When** the agent responds in Dutch
**Then** tokens must stream correctly with proper UTF-8 encoding for Dutch characters (ë, ö, etc.)

#### AC-FEAT-010-008: English Streaming
**Given** the user asks a question in English
**When** the agent responds in English
**Then** tokens must stream correctly with same performance as Dutch responses

### User Story 4: Error Handling

**As a** workplace safety specialist
**I want** clear error messages if streaming fails
**So that** I understand what went wrong and can retry

#### AC-FEAT-010-009: Network Interruption
**Given** a streaming response is in progress
**When** the network connection is interrupted
**Then** the UI must display an error message and allow retry without losing accumulated text

#### AC-FEAT-010-010: Stream Timeout
**Given** the LLM takes longer than 60 seconds to complete
**When** the timeout threshold is reached
**Then** the stream must close gracefully with a timeout error message

#### AC-FEAT-010-011: Backend Error Handling
**Given** the backend encounters an error during streaming
**When** the error occurs
**Then** the frontend must receive an error event and display a user-friendly message

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

#### AC-FEAT-010-012: Time to First Token
**Given** a typical query (50-100 tokens)
**When** measured across 100 requests
**Then** 95th percentile time-to-first-token must be under 500ms

#### AC-FEAT-010-013: Long Response Stability
**Given** a query that generates 2000+ tokens
**When** streaming the response
**Then** the stream must remain stable without stuttering or freezing

#### AC-FEAT-010-014: Concurrent Streams
**Given** 10 users simultaneously streaming queries
**When** all streams are active
**Then** each stream must maintain <500ms first-token latency and smooth delivery

### Reliability

#### AC-FEAT-010-015: Memory Management
**Given** 50 consecutive streaming queries
**When** all queries complete
**Then** no memory leaks must be detectable (backend or frontend)

#### AC-FEAT-010-016: Connection Cleanup
**Given** a user navigates away during streaming
**When** the browser closes the connection
**Then** the backend must detect disconnection and clean up resources within 5 seconds

### Security

#### AC-FEAT-010-017: Authentication Enforcement
**Given** an unauthenticated user attempts to access the streaming endpoint
**When** the connection is attempted
**Then** the request must be rejected with 401 Unauthorized

#### AC-FEAT-010-018: Rate Limiting
**Given** a user makes more than 20 streaming requests in 1 minute
**When** the rate limit is exceeded
**Then** subsequent requests must be rejected with 429 Too Many Requests

### Compatibility

#### AC-FEAT-010-019: Browser Support
**Given** the supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**When** accessing the streaming interface
**Then** streaming must work consistently across all supported browsers

#### AC-FEAT-010-020: Mobile Responsiveness
**Given** a user accesses the system on a mobile device
**When** streaming a response
**Then** the streaming UI must be responsive and performant on mobile networks

## Edge Cases

#### AC-FEAT-010-021: Empty Response
**Given** the LLM generates an empty response
**When** the stream completes
**Then** the UI must display a message indicating no content was generated

#### AC-FEAT-010-022: Rapid Consecutive Queries
**Given** a user submits a new query before the previous stream completes
**When** the new query is submitted
**Then** the previous stream must be cancelled and the new stream must start immediately

#### AC-FEAT-010-023: Special Characters
**Given** a response contains special characters (emoji, mathematical symbols, etc.)
**When** streaming the response
**Then** all special characters must render correctly without encoding issues
